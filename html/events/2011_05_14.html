<h2>Corvallis Riverfront Go Tournament</h2>

<h3>Where:</h3>

<p>The Riverfront Restaurant<br />
603 NW 2nd Street<br />
Corvallis, OR  97330</p>

<h3>When:</h3>

<p>Saturday, May 14<br />
doors open at 8:30<br />
ground rules described at 9:15<br />
matches begin at 9:30</p>

<h3>What:</h3>

<p>An AGA rated, "modified" self paired event<br />
AGA rated:  please be sure your memberships are current</p>

<p>Modified:  all double digit kyu players present at 9:30 will have 
three matches arranged before we begin ... some single digit players will 
get matches assigned to them to ensure three matches for the teen-kyu players; 
any player who wishes assistance in getting three matches will be helped</p>

<p>self paired: in general, we know who our opponents are, 
and who is close to us in the pack -- those are the matches that you want to get.  
Similar to club-play, when one match finishes you are free  to start the next one.  
Three rated matches is the fewest any should have at the end of the day; 
four or more should not be uncommon.</p>

<h3>How:</h3>
40 minute clocks; 4 period of 40 second byo yomi (a "4x4" tournament)

<h3>Who:</h3>

<p>At the moment we have 20 players expecting to be there, 
including (so far) five of the top six active rated players in Oregon.  
These top players will be able to match up with each other in this format 
to see who is the top Oregon player for 2011. </p>


<h3>Cost:</h3>

<p>$20 entrance fee<br />
lunch is included; we cover the food, you cover the beverages</p>
