In Salem, Oregon's beautiful capital!  Across the street from the
capitol!  Prizes in the various divisions, plus for best record under
18, and best record under 12!

<b>What:</b>
A three round, Ing rules (assuming Ing funding), AGA rated, handicap, 1
hour/side plus 5 segments of 30 seconds event.

<b>Where:</b>
408 Collins Hall, Willamette University, 900 State St., Salem OR.
<a href="http://www.willamette.edu/map/">www.willamette.edu/map/</a>
has a campus map.  The directions are: I-5 to exit 253, turn towards

<b>How:</b>
Simply send email indicating your intention to play to:

<b>Details:</b>
Free lunch!  Three choices are: pizza, sandwiches, or chinese.  If you
have a preference, please indicate it when you preregister (majority wins).

Coffee, pop and bagels provided.

Fridge and microwave in the room next door (otherwise food is several
blocks away).

If the Ing funding comes through prizes will be relatively lavish, if
it does not (and I haven't heard from the AGA person yet) they will be
relatively minimal.

A query:
Perhaps, depending on who attends, we might want to try out some
alternative format.  Like groups of four and play round robins.  Or a
no handicap section.  If you favor either of these, let me know that
too when preregistering.
