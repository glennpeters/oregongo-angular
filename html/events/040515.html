<h2>Corvallis Spring Go Tournament</h2>

Hey players

Time for the Annual Corvallis Spring Go Tournament (5th!).

Saturday, May 15, doors open at 9 AM, round 1 starts at 10 AM.  Three
rounds of handicap go.  Ing rules (likely) AGA rated (definitely).

$20 entrance fee; no fee for high school players or younger.

We will be at the community room of the majestic theater on 2nd ave
in Corvallis.  This year we have also reserved the room across the
hall from the tournament for discussion, game reviews, etc.

For you round robin players, come say hi to your opponents :D.

I'm trying a web registration this time, and apologize for not having
a Corvallis Go Club page (yet).  Which means I need to redirect you
to:

<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~rtomalley/Pacific.GO.Monthly/upcoming2.htm" target="_new">Pacific Go Monthly</a>

You'll find driving directions there, along with the place to register.

I'll do my best to make sure that all players receive gifts once again.

Also, Corvallis will be promoting (at least) 4 new players to shodan (or
stronger).  Maybe 6.  And, bizarre as it sounds, it could be more.  At
the same time, we will be bringing in eight (more?) new youth players
to the tournament loop, with new players from 8th, 6th, 5th, and even
possibly 3rd grade present.

Last year we had 42 players; this time we should could bump into 50.
Say hi to our new players from Eugene, and from *Bend* (hello Bend Go
Club).

Please sign up in advance; preregistration makes *everything* easier.

cheers
