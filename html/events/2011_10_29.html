<p><b>TRANSPORTATION</b>: Parking on campus is free on the weekends. If you're coming from downtown Portland, you can take the Pioneer Express shuttle bus:</p>

<p>(Note that the shuttle route has changed slightly from last year.)</p>

<p><b>FOOD</b>: Bon Appetit has a monopoly contract for all catering on campus, 
so it's a very bad deal for us to order coffee. Instead, we've 
discovered that there is a coffee shop (Maggie's) open on campus. The 
Fields Dining Room is also open for a buffet lunch. Info on both can 
be found here:</p>

<p>Note that Maggie's doesn't open until 10:00 AM on the weekend, so if
you need an infusion of caffeine before your first round, bring
something along.</p>
