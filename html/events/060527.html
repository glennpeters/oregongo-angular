<h2>Oregon Go Open 2006 (Corvallis)</h2>

<b>What:</b> Oregon Go Open 2006

<b>Where:</b> [http://www.majestic.org/pages/streetmaps.html Majestic Theatre, 115 SW 2nd ST, Corvallis]

<b>When:</b> May 27th, registration starts at 8:30am, rounds to start at 9:30am

<b>Details:</b>

<p>Refreshments (coffee, tea, soda) and snacks (muffins, chips/crackers) will
be provided, but you will be responsible for your own lunch. There will be
three rounds of handicap go using AGA rules with 45 minutes on the clock
and 3 rounds of 30 second byo-yomi. Round 1 will begin at 9:30 am. We will
take a break for lunch at or before 12pm, and luckily there are plenty of
options for lunch in downtown Corvallis. If I wasn't the TD for this
tournament, I'd be visting Aomatsu for some of the best sushi in the
valley. Round 2 will start at or just before 1 pm, and finally round 3
starting as soon as all of round 2 results are turned in. After round 3,
prizes will be distributed and we are out of there. We must be entirely out
of the building by 6pm at the very latest.</p>

<p>I have rented the 'Class Room' for people to hang out and play games
between rounds if they wish, otherwise just be quiet and respectful if you
choose to observe games in progress.</p>

<p>Entry Fee for adults is $20 for those who pre-register. Youth under 18 is
$5. College students $10. Tack on $5 extra for those who don't
pre-register, because it is really helpful for us to know how many people
to prepare for.</p>

<p>Prizes will be divided into three divisions: Dan, Single digit Kyu, and
Double digit Kyu. Depending on the attendance, I'd like to also include a
special prize category for youth players under 14 or 15. Prizes are a
little bit in limbo right now, but it will likely be cash for Dan players
and a mix of cash, gift certificates to Go vendors, and/or books for Kyu
players. Please send me your thoughts on the prizes if you wish.</p>

<p>If anyone has books they wish to donate to the prize pool, or other prize
ideas (a plaque?) please e-mail Josh.</p>

<p>Pre-register by sending me an email at josh@revgum.com with your name, if
you're in the 14-15 or younger age group, AGA rank or estimated rank, AGA
number and if you need to register for the AGA.</p>

<p>There is a $5 extra fee for non-AGA members to participate in the
tournament.</p>

<p>If any of you need to stay a night and need help finding lodging, let me
know.</p>

<p>Thanks, and tell everyone you know.<br />
