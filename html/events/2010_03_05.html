<p><strong>Location</strong></p>

<p>Rooms 203 and 204, on the second floor of the Hauser Library... easily accessible by elevator, and there's a staircase that goes straight to the rooms. It's separated from the quiet section of the building, so it should suit us well.</p>

<p>Here's a map: <a href="http://www.reed.edu/facilities_and_grounds/reed_static_map.html">http://www.reed.edu/facilities_and_grounds/reed_static_map.html</a></p>

<p>East parking is near the library, and should be available for us. There's plenty of room on Woodstock as well. </p>
