<h1>2019 Oregon State Go Championship</h1>

<h2>September 21 and 22, 2019</h2>

<p>
    This is the first annual state championship tournament. Format is a five-round Swiss-McMahon tournament (everyone
    plays all five rounds). It will be held on September 21 and 22, 2019, in the beautiful 
    <a href="https://japanesegarden.org/">Portland Japanese Garden</a>. 
    (<a href="https://g.page/PortlandJapaneseGarden?share">Map</a>)
    This is an AGA-rated tournament, so AGA membership is required. Because winners will receive AGA-sanctioned 
    state titles, "one event" membership will not be honored. You do not have to be an Oregon resident to play 
    in this tournament.
</p>

<p>
    In the open section, the highest finisher who is also an Oregon resident will be awarded the Championship trophy.
    Trophies and state-wide "braggin' rights" will also be given for top finishers in the handicap sections. Cash and
    merchandise prizes will go to the top places in each section as well, with a special purse of $500.00 for the open
    section. Entry fees will be $25.00 per adult and $15.00 for those under the age of 18 on September 22. Entry to the
    Japanese Garden will be waived for all participants.
</p>

<p>
    IMPORTANT! Due to space restrictions, only a limited number of players will be able to participate. See next
    paragraph for instructions to apply for participation. All players must apply and register in advance so we can
    arrange for entry to the Garden. Applicants will be placed on a list by order of receipt of application with
    priority for open section players. There is no cost to apply for participation. Fees will be settled in August.
    After AGA membership expiration dates have been confirmed and the entry fees have been received, a list of
    participants will be published. After you apply, it is important to watch for notices and respond within the time
    period allowed to complete your application, or you will be dropped from the list to make space for another player.
    There will not be time or mechanism afforded for "entry at the door."
