<p>(Note that the shuttle route has changed slightly from last year.)</p>


<p><b>HOTEL:</b> The Hilton Garden Inn in Lake Oswego will offer a discount
group rate. Double queen rooms are $84 per night. Call 503-706-7691 to
reserve your room before October 8.</p>


<p><b>FOOD:</b> Bon Apetit has a monopoly contract for all catering on campus,
so it's a very bad deal for us to order coffee. Instead, we've
discovered that there is a coffee shop (Maggie's) open on campus. The
Fields Dining Room is also open for a buffet lunch. Info on both can
be found here:</p>

<p>Note that Maggie's doesn't open until 10:00 AM on the weekend, so if
you need an infusion of caffeine before your first round, bring
something along.</p>
