<p><b>Timing:</b>  60-minute clocks w/ 5 overtime periods of 40 seconds each.</p>

<p><b>Divisions:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>TOP dan  (no handicap)</li>
	<li>dan</li>
	<li>single-digit kyu</li>
	<li>double-digit kyu</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>The TOP dan division is an "open" division; anyone can enter but no handicaps will be given;  recommend 5D and stronger</li>

	<li>The other three divisions (dan, single digit kyu, double digit kyu) are prize divisions; players may be matched up across these division boundaries.</li>

	<li>There will be $1200 in prizes for the TOP dan division; other prize distributions to be determined.</li>

	<li>There were 40 participants at this tournament last year, and 40 the year before that; we expect the same number or more this year; 50 players is not an unreasonable number to anticipate.</li>

	<li>Expect there to be a strong field of players ranging across all division boundaries. </li>

	<li>Preregistration *closes* at 5 pm Thursday, October 4, 2001.</li>

</ol>


<p>Last year was complicated with two different divisions, using
two different sets of timing, with different numbers of rounds,
and two different tournament directors.  It was like we were
running two different tournaments.  After another year of
hosting tournaments, I think we can simplify pretty easily.</p>

<p>All players, kyu and dan, will have the same number of rounds,
and the same clocks.  The consensus before was that 60-minute
rounds was the quickest possible for playing with the big-boys,
and we will retain that.  Both Salem and Corvallis tournaments
used 60-minute clocks.  Portland T, though, will use overtime.
Last year we did 5 periods of 30-seconds for ING clocks; this
year we will try 5 periods of 40-second clocks (I recall at least
two matches last year that were called on account of time).
I am arranging for more ING clocks; hopefully we will have
enough, if not, we'll work it out.</p>

<p>Using 60 minute clocks, plus overtime, I guestimate the max
time for each round to be 2 hours, 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Here's my guestimate on timing, given that constraint:</p>

<p>I've made preliminary arrangements for generous fundmatching from
the ING Foundation and the AGA.  More clocks, stones, and boards
have been requested.  Also, the Corvallis Go Club is attempting
to make ~25 game boards for tournament use.  I've continued
to be in contact with Mr. Robbins, author of the WinTD software,
and have used new versions of it in Salem, and Corvallis, since
Portland last year.</p>

<p>The last two tournaments since Portland have seen a shift away
from concentrated cash prizes to a wider distribution of cash
and merchandise.  In Corvallis, literaly every player was able
to recieve some form of prize.  Cash will still be used in Portland,
with emphasis on the dan players.  For those of you who wish to
play without prizes, please arrange to donate your prizes to
the Corvallis Go Club :))))  Resources are always appreciated :)</p>

<p>Regarding general awards, I started thinking about delivery of
a prize for the player with the most tournament wins in the
Oregon tournament circuit (Salem - Corvallis - Portland).  Right
now I believe Mr. Tsukamoto leads, but I need to do the tally
again.  Other awards of acknowlegment are a good idea and will
be considered.</p>

<p>This year I will try tending this tournament as the solo TD as part of the 
simplifications.  My extreme thanks to Michael Alford on the prior two 
tournaments in Portland.  Without his impetus two years ago, this tournament 
would not be in place today.  And, without his volunteering his time away 
from work, the previous two Portland tournaments wouldn't have happened.  
Oregon players, and Portland players in particular, received a great benefit 
that day when Michael checked in with Albyn to see if we could have a 
tournament at Reed College.</p>
