To get this rate, you must register by October 9 and tell them you're
coming for the Portland Go Tournament.


FOOD: Bon Apetit has a monopoly contract for all catering on campus,
so it's a very bad deal for us to order coffee. Instead, we've
discovered that there is a coffee shop (Maggie's) open on campus. The
Fields Dining Room is also open for a buffet lunch. Info on both can
be found here:

Note that Maggie's doesn't open until 10:00 AM on the weekend, so if
you need an infusion of caffeine before your first round, bring
something along.
