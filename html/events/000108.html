<h2>Second Annual Salem Winter Go Tournament</h2>

<hr noshade width="100%">

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" SIZE="+2">What: </FONT><BR>
A five round, Ing rules, AGA rated and funded (thanks Bob!), handicap,  
40-minutes plus byo-yomi (20 stones in 5 minutes) event.</P>

<P>Three divisions with 9 stone spreads.  The exact divisions will depend on  
the strongest entered player.  Assuming the strongest is a 4-dan, then the  
divisions would be: </P>

<DIR>
<P>6k-4d<BR>
16k-7k<BR>
17k and up</P>

<P><I>Assuming the strongest player was a 2d:</I><BR>
8k-2d<BR>
18k-9k<BR>
19k and up</P>
</DIR>

<p>We're still not invoking Ing's special case ko rules; hot stones and breaths can wait for another day.  There won't be penalty points for use of overtime.  If we use overtime it will be 5 min/20 stones (rather than timing per stone).  There won't be compensation to white for black taking handicap stones.  All in all, it's how the Ing rules were handled in Portland.</p>

<p>Jim Levenick is the host and TD, Bob O'Malley help where he can ... maybe with the third division.</p>
