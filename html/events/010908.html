<p>Sponsored by the Corvallis Go Club</p>

<p>We expect a diverse range of playing strengths to be present.  We are 
considering having informal matches on the side, game reviews, and lectures 
over the two-day workshop.  To help focus the content for the different 
players, we will likely break up into groups of different playing strengths.</p>


<p>We hope that you can participate in this two-day workshop.  However,
if you cannot participate on both days, you might be able to make it
for one day.  You may register for Saturday only if you wish ($70).</p>

<p>Please send e-mail of intent to participate (or questions) to:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:gailcape@home.com">gailcape@home.com</a></p>


<p>Just indicate your playing strength, and we'll pass
that info along to Ms. Kim so she can prep for our specific
group.  Please indicate whether you are signing up for both
days, or just Saturday.</p>

<p>You may send in your registration fee ahead of time.
Please make the check payable to:</p>

<ul>

<p>You can pay at the door if you like, but you still need
to e-mail register ahead of time.</p>

<p>Getting to Cheldelin Middle School Library
(987 NE Conifer Blvd.)  
Coming from the North or the South on I-5, continue
until you get to Hwy 34, the Corvallis-Lebanon exit.
Take that exit and go west (11 miles) on Hwy 34 until
you get to Corvallis.  Be sure you are in the right-hand
lane as you cross the small bridge into Corvallis; you
need to turn right (north) just as you get over the
bridge.  You are now on Hwy 20.  Continue north along the 
river until the 2nd stopight (Conifer Blvd).  Turn left
(west) on Conifer Blvd.  Cheldelin is on Conifer, just
past the railroad tracks.  You can park in the bus lane,
or in the parking lot.  The entrance we will be
using is near the flag pole (on the south side, near
the bus lane).  Signs will be posted.</p>

<p><b>Corvallis Lodging</b></p>

<p>There are two motels that you see just as you are coming in to
town from I-5, as you go over the bridge into town.  One
is the Econo Lodge, and the other is the Super 8 Motel
(these prices are for one person in a room with a Queen size bed):</p>

<ul>
	<b>Econo Lodge</b><br>
	345 NW 2nd St<br>
	(541) 752-9601<br>
	<br>
	$40 + tax (discounted rate)
</ul>

<ul>
	<b>Super 8 Motel</b><br>
	407 NW @nd St<br>
	(541) 758-8088<br>
	<br>
	$60 + tax
</ul>

<p>There's another possibility on 2nd ave, if you head north (the 
Holiday Inn Express) but it has no vacancies ...</p>

<p>If you continue in to town until you get to 9th, and turn
right (north) there are two other good choices:</p>

<ul>
	<b>Best Western</b><br>
	925 NW Garfield<br>
	(541) 758-8571<br>
	<br>
	$79 + tax  (King size bed, not Queen)
</ul>

<ul>
	<b>Ramada Inn</b><br>
	1550 NW 9th St<br>
	(541) 753-9151<br>
	<br>
	$79 + tax  (restaurant, lounge, pool)
</ul>

<p>Both of these are pretty close together, too.</p>

<p>That's a good starter list.  I don't know what qualifies
as "discounted rate" for Econo Lodge ... if it doesn't
apply I figure it must be normaly pretty close to what
the Super 8 charges (they are right next to each other).
Maybe you need to mention you are coming in to town
for a workshop on September 8, and had been quoted the
discounted rate of $40 for one night.
</p>
<p>Tax (I believe) is 9%.</p>

<p>Best Western and Ramada are likely more comfortable, but
they cost more.</p>
