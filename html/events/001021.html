<p>We plan a four division event, an Open and a Dan section, playing 
five games over two days, one hour on the clock and five 30 second periods 
of byo-yomi using the Ing Timers.  The two kyu divisions will be seven 
games over two days, using chess clocks so they can use the more familiar 
25 stones in 10 mins byo-yomi.  We expect in excess of 50 players this 
year.  </p>

	<p>Divisions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>open</li>
		<li>dan</li>
		<li>single digit kyu</li>
		<li>double digit kyu</li>
	</ul>

and right now we have players registered from 24 kyu up to 6 dan.


<p>And, please bring your boards (stones and timers supplied)</p>
