<p>Note that Maggie's doesn't open until noon on the weekend, so if you need an
infusion of caffeine before your first round, bring something along.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN</h2>

<p>We definitely want to encourage children to play and enjoy the game.
We also want adults to be able to concentrate without excessive distraction or
disruption. We therefore must insist that all children under 9 be supervised by
a non-playing adult.</p>
