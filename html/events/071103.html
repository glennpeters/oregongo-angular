<p>Note that Maggie's doesn't open until 10:00 AM on the weekend, so if
you need an infusion of caffeine before your first round, bring
something along.</p>

<p>PRECISE LOCATION: We will once again be in Smith Hall, which is a room
in Albany Quandrangle (which is, confusingly enough, a building). A
campus map is here:</p>

<p>We'll try to do a better job with signage this year; the bozos who put 
up the signs last year have been given a stern glare.</p>
