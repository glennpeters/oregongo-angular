<p>There will be three rounds of handicap go using aga rules. Round 1 will begin at
9:00 am. Pizza will be served for lunch at approximatly 12 pm, and refreshments
will be available throughout. Round 2 is scheduled for 1 pm, with round 3
starting as soon as all of round 2 results are turned in. After round 3, prizes
will be distributed and we will call it a day.</p>

<p>Entry Fee is 20$ for those who pre-register. Youth under 18 is 5$. College
students 10$. Tack on 5$ extra for those who don't pre-register, It really is
helpful for the people who are helping to know what we need to prepare for as
far as food, boards, etc.</p>

<p>Prizes will be divided into three divisions: Dan, Single digit Kyu, and double
digit. Prizes will be mostly cash, with first place trophies for each division. 
There will also be an extra youth prize division.</p>

<p>Pre-register by sending e-mail to bazzanoj@onid.orst.edu with your name,
aga rank or estimated rank, aga number and if you need to register for the aga.
There is a 5$ extra fee for non-AGA members to participate in the tournament.</p>
