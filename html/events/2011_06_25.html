<h2>Salem Go Workshop with Guo Juan</h2>

<p>Group size is limited to 14 for now, so there are nine slots remaining.  The focus will be on the middle game, 
and we will have four short lectures along with game reviews for the kyu group and the dan group.  
Cost is $120 for the weekend; because this is so close the Corvallis tournament, 
cost to those participants is reduced to $100.  Ms. Guo is a very popular teacher at the Go Congresses, 
and runs an <a href="http://internetgoschool.com/">online Go School</a>.</p>
