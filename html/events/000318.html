<h2><I>The Go Masters</I> showing and Go Discussions</h2>

<hr noshade width="100%">

<P>Doug Cable graciously Go players to his house for a showing of The Go Masters and  some Go discussions and practice on Saturday, March 18th:</P>

<blockquote>
<P>People are welcome to show up anytime after 11 AM and stay util the 
wee hours of the morning.  I don't plan to host refreshments but we 
can do the usual go-thing:  Bring what you want and we can always send 
out for pizza, go out for a bite, or whatever.</P>

<P>I have a poolroom for go players who might like to take a break with 
that vice (bring your own booze and floozies).  We can watch the Go 
Masters as often as people want at only $2.50 per ticket (just 
kidding).  Bring handkerchiefs, since it's a tear-jerker.  No phony 
coughing and snuffling allowed, while mumbling something about "just 
can't seem to shake this damn cold..."</P>

<P>I hope some of you might want to try one of my favorite group go 
activities:  team go (not the one where everyone alternates moves).  I 
like the version where the players on each team have an open 
discussion of their next move, right in front of the other team, and 
pick a move after looking at some alternatives.  It's very 
educational, lots of fun and usually leads to really interesting 
games.</P>

<P>Directions for getting to Doug Cable's house.</P>

<P>Address: 2306 NE 152nd Circle, Vancouver, WA 98686<br>
Phone: 360 574-8915<br>
General area: Mt. Vista area of Vancouver, about where the  I-5 and the 205 merge.</P>

<P>I-5 north:</P>
<ul>
<li>exit at 134th, roughly 8 miles north of the interstate bridge.</li>
<li>turn right on 134th, go to the 2nd light (20th) and turn
  left (north). This is almost immediate, so start working your
  way into the left lane as soon as you exit the I-5.  But
  don't make the mistake of turning left at the first light or 
  you'll find yourself headed north on the I-5 again.</li>
</ul>

<P>205 north:</P>
<ul>
<li>exit at 134th and turn left (west).  The first light, just
  ahead, is 20th.  Turn right (north) there. </li>
</ul>

<P>I-5 south:</P>
<li>take the 205 exit when you come to it. While you're still on
  the exit curve you'll see the 134th exit.  Take it and turn
  left on 134th. </li>
<li>Immediately ahead is 20th.  Turn left (north) there.</li>
<B>NOTE</B>: you will only see the 134th exit sign once you've taken
      the 205 exit. 

<P>Once you've all turned north on 20th:</P>
<ul>
<li>Go 9/10 of a mile and turn right on 152nd Street.  It's a
  two-block long street (becoming 152nd Circle at the 2nd
  block) that goes uphill and ends in a cul-de-sac. We are 
  the 2nd or 3rd house, on the left, from the top of the circle.</li>
</ul>

<P>On the 18th, please try not to arrive before 11 AM, but you're
welcome anytime after that.  I have 4 go sets at home, but since
I have no idea how many might show up, at least half of you
should plan on bringing sets. </P>
